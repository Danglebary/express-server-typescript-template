# express-typescript-server-template

A simple express server template built with typescript.

# Getting started

-   run `yarn` to install dependencies

# Scripts

-   `yarn build`: Compiles Typescript files in 'src' to js in 'dist/'.
-   `yarn start`: Runs node project from 'dist/' directory. (must be built first!)
-   `yarn dev`: Concurrently runs both the Typescript compiler with the watch flag, -w, and nodemon in the 'dist/' directory for hot-reloading.
